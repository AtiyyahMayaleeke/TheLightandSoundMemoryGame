## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
The process of creating this game and using different languages has been really fascinating and fun to build. The instructions were incredibly clear and while at the start, I was so sure I would need to use outside sources, everything (including the additional information references) was well explained and I didn't require it. Though, I have some topics I would like to further research for my own learning from this process.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
A challenge that I encountered in creating this submission was mainly keeping track of what task was written in what file so that when it came to debugging, I was working in the right spot. I am very thankful to have had a great foundation when it came to functions and loops and so despite the new technical languages, I was easily able to comprehend the general task at hand and simply implement them into a new language. Debugging definitely was the main challenge, specifically when trying to write out the guess function. I attempted to do it on my own first and was making progress. I decided to first handle the case when the button choice was wrong to avoid going any further into the case and simply being the loseGame sequence. But my version would initially not get past 2 rounds and other minor glitches. Once looking at the solution, it made sense in my thought process and I realized solutions donâ€™t always have to be very complex to get the job done.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
I definitely would like to learn more about how the different layers (HTML, CSS, and Js) interact with one another. This simplified version made all the files super easy to access and switch in between but what would a process like this look like without the help of a site like this. I would also like to see how complex a website is as well as the tab/class/variable keeping aspect is utilized

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
I would have loved to add a timed function such as a speed round or even an option to make teams and take turns with another player, adding visuals for tallies. I would also go back to the guess function above and attempt to workshop my thought process again.
